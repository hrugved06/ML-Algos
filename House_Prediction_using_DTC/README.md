## House Price Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Challenge, here we will use a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to accurately predict the house prices in India. Accurately predicting house prices can be a daunting task. The buyers are just not concerned about the size(square feet) of the house and there are various other factors that play a key role to decide the price of a house/property. It can be extremely difficult to figure out the right set of attributes that are contributing to understanding the buyer's behavior as such. This dataset has been collected across various property aggregators across India. In this model, provided there are multiple influencing factors to predict the prices as accurately as possible.
